                        Hey there, tech enthusiasts! It's Orohym here, and I'm excited to share my experience of
                        building my own handmade NAS/home server in this blog. As a tech and DIY enthusiast, I'm always
                        on the lookout for exciting and challenging projects, and building a server has been one of my
                        most thrilling projects yet. In this post, I'll be discussing why I decided to build a server
                        and the requirements I had for it. So, let's dive in!

                    <h2>
                        Why build a server?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        As we all know, we're
                        becoming increasingly dependent on cloud services to store our data and stream media. While
                        these services are convenient, they come with their own set of challenges and limitations.
                        Building a server is a great way to break free from these limitations and take control of your
                        data. It also provides a level of privacy that can't be achieved with cloud services. With this
                        in mind, I decided to explore the available tools and technologies and build my own server.
                        Moreover, building and creating things excite me, and by doing it myself, I can adapt everything
                        to suit my needs the best.

                    <h2>
                        My Server Requirements
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        With the motivation for creating a server established, the next step was to identify the exact
                        requirements I would need. Therefore, I meticulously wrote down all the requirements that my
                        server needed to meet before starting the project. These requirements included backup storage
                        for my MacOs and Windows devices, a media storage solution for my movies, pictures, music, and
                        e-books, a media server to stream my movies and music, and a smart home server to automate
                        various tasks and control my smart home devices. With the requirements for my server clearly
                        defined, the next step was to start building. Here's how I went about it.

                    <h2>
                        The Building Process
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        To build my server, I conducted research on the available hardware, software, and tools that
                        could help me achieve my goals. After much consideration, I settled on the hardware and software
                        that met my requirements and budget. I'll explain this in detail in the next post, and future
                        posts will detail specific steps that I took to build this server.

                        I hope this blog post provides you with some inspiration and guidance on how to build your own
                        server. I'll try to provide as many references as I can to justify the choices that I've made.
                        Of course, it's up to you to adapt these ideas to your personal case. Thanks for reading, and
                        I'll see you in the next post! &#128522

                    <em>PS: </em> As a way to improve my knowledge in web development, I made the decision to code this
                    website from scratch. The design of the website was highly inspired by
                    <a href="https://yetiops.net/">https://yetiops.net/</a>. I hope you enjoy exploring the website as
                    much as I enjoyed creating it!
